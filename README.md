# PopulationSimulator

### A population simulator written in Python (3) that should accurately model the genetic changes in a population over time.
### Note that this is a work in progress, and is nowhere near complete.

TODO:
* Add variability to account for immigration, emmigration
* Add option to control predators/preyAdd natural disasters, human intrusion, other factors
* Calculate genetic variation using the Hardy-Weinberg equation
